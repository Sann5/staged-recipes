  summary: 'Run SQL directly on delimited files and multi-file sqlite databases'
  description: |
    q's purpose is to bring SQL expressive power to the Linux command line and to provide easy access to text as actual data. It allows 1)
    performing SQL-like statements directly on tabular text data, auto-caching the data in order to accelerate additional querying on the same file, and 2)
    performing SQL statements directly on multi-file sqlite3 databases, without having to merge them or load them into memory.
